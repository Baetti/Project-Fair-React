        1. To create react project : npx create-react-app project-name    
        2. To run React : npm start
        3. To generate node module : npm install (if not available)(project doesnot run without node modules)
        4. To install Material UI : npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

                           Basic Features & Concepts
                ------------------------------------------------

        
        - Is a collection of Js Libraries: Used to design UI
        - Creating a Single Page Application : GMAIL, FACEBOOK, X
        - Declarative Approach: Developers describe how the user interface should look based on its current state, and React takes care of updating the DOM (Document Object Model) accordingly.

        - Immutable & Mutable
        - Pure Functions : Functions accept immutable objects and return a new object - It didnot cause any side effect : Example - React Components

        - Virtual DOM : A programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

        - JSX (Javascript XML) - Combination of Javascript and HTML : const heading = <h1>heading 1</h1>
        - Transpling : JSX to (HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT) - using Babel library
         
            - JSX expression must have a parent element 
            - React fragments : <> </> similar to <div> </div>
            - Changes in Attribute : always use camel letters 
                
                - class become className
                - for become htmlFor
            - To display JS expression in JSX : place js expression inside a {}

            - To style use Inline styling in component - where css property should be in camel case in an object
            - Every jsx elements have closing tag 
            - Tag without contents can be represented as self closing tags : <tag/>
            

        - Create react app using create-react-app command
        - Components : Small part of a User Interface(UI), React app is a collection of components, they are arranged as a tree structure with parent/start node as 'App' Component
           - Component is a js/jsx file, with filename & component name will start with capital letter, it will always return HTML

              - Different ways to create components
                
                  - Functional/stateless Components
                  - Class based/stateful components

              - High Order Component (HOC) : Component as a Component Argument and returns a jsx/component

                  Shortcuts to create components
                
                             - rfce (react function component extends)
                             - rcc (react class component)

        - Data Sharing in React Component : One way binding - Parent to child 

                - Using props : property of Component

                     - It is an object
                     - Child can access shared data from its Function argument via props

        - Style React Components

                - Inline Styling
                - External Styling
                - CSS Module : file with a extension of .module.css

        - React Events

                - Without argument function : Events bind using its function name only  
                - With argument function : Events bind using arrow function
                - With event object as argument : Events bind using arrow function with argument as event   

        - Conditional Rendering :  Process of displaying different content based on certain conditions or states. 

                - if statements : && operator
                - if-else statements : ?: Ternary operator

        - React state : Built in Object of React Component(By default, only for class based component)
                
                - It will store property of Components
                - State Changes then it re-render the Component : use setState function
        
        - Render - Rendering is the process used to show the output of markup and code to the user in the browser. 

        - React Component Life Cycle

                - Mounting Phase : Putting all elements into DOM

                          - constructor()
                          - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                          - render()
                          - componentDidMount()

                - Updating Phase : Component Updating
                          
                          - getDerivedStateFromProps()
                          - shouldComponentUpdate()
                          - render()
                          - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
                          - componentDidUpdate()

                - Unmounting phase : removing element from DOM
                          
                          - componentWillUnmount()

        - React Hooks : for making Functional Component to use react Features (eg: state,life cycle) 
               hook:- Function or Predefinedfunction

                - Import hook, and to use call the hook inside the component
                - Rules for hook:

                          - Can used only in Functional Component
                          - It can only called at the top level of Component 
                          - Hooks are not Conditional                 
                
                - Different type of Hooks
                        
                          - Predefined Hooks
                                   
                                   - useState(initial-value) : Return state and function for Updating State
                                   
                                   - useEffect Hook : The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
                                        
                                        - Syntax :- useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)

                                        - No dependency argument : useEffect runs on every render.

                                        - An empty array : Runs only on the first render.

                                        - Props or State value : Runs on the first render, And any time any dependency value changes

                                   - useNavigate : Redirect one page to another

                                   -useDispatch
                                   -useSelector

                          - Custom Hooks

                - DIfference between Functional and class based component

                     Functional Component                           Class based Component
                ------------------------------                  ------------------------------

                1.JS pure function accept props as               1. A class extended from react component
                  argument and return jsx (react elements)           and render a function and return jsx
                                                                     (react elements)

                2.No need of render function                     2. Need render function to return jsx

                3.Run code from top to bottom,once               3. Component alive depending on the 
                jsx return it cannot be alive                       life cycle phase

                4.Stateless Component                            4. Stateful component

                5.Hooks are used                                 5. No need to use hook

                6.Constructor is not used                        6. Use constructor to initialise
                                                                    the state

                7.Life Cycle methods like componentDidMount      7. Can use Life Cycle methods inside 
                  is not used                                       component


                - Rendering List : use map method

                - React Form :

                          - Form handled by component

                          - preventDefault() - method cancels the event if it is cancelable

                          - Types of components
                              - controlled component - managed by react component
                              - uncontrolled component - managed by DOM
                
                
                - API call - In React,
                               
                               - Using Axios library :- it returns promise

                                    - create a new instance of axios with a custom config(if multiple http requests are calling into base url)
                                         
                                    - Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser.

                                    - It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same basecode)

                - Routing/set up path for component in React

                            - Use react-router-dom library
                               
                                   - Entire application should be in BrowserRouter

                                   - Place all component needed to set up path inside Routes in App Components

                                   - To set up path for component use Route in inside Routes

                            - Link :
                                   - Used to redirect from one page to another page without reloading

                            - useNavigate Hook :
                                 
                                   - redirection
                            

        REDUX - State Management System
                     
                     - Inorder to avoid props drilling
                     - Working flow : 
                         
                                        payload
                            Actions-------------------Reducers
                                |                       |
                                |                       |
                       dispacth |                       |  update
                                |                       |
                                |                       |
                         Components--------------------Store
                                   select update state


                         - Store: js file which can be globally accessed in react app

                             - Used to store data
                             - To provide store to react app use Provider selector from react-redux library
                             - To access updated state from store by component using useSelector Hook
                        
                        - Actions: js file to define logic to update state which is needed by the component
                             
                             - To Update state, component has to dispatch the Actions
                             - To dispatch action use useDispatch hook from react-redux library
                        
                        Reducers : js file used to update state in store file
                             
                             - While dispatching action its response(payload) will go to Reducers
                             - Only Reducers are capable of updating state in REDUX

         
        REDUX Toolkit : Standard way to write Redux Logic
                          
                        - It resolves the following 

                             - "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
                             - "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
                             - "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

                APIs in toolkit
                         
                        - configureStore()- to create store
                        - createReducer()-
                        - createAction()-
                        -
